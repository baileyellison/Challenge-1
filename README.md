# 01 HTML and CSS Challenge for a coding Bootcamp

This was a challenge given for week one material learned in bootcamp. The repo contains HTML and CSS with basic features and demonstration of knowledge with code refractoring. The sample project was for a marketing agency which wanted some changes to be made to have more accessible features like alternative text for images and links that have the ability to be accessed. Those links are in the credits below.

# Installation
N/A

# Usage
A user can navigate the page to see the different topics the marketing agency is offering. Once those topics are selected, within the header or within the body of the webpage itself, the site links externally to the sources below. The code itself has been cleaned up and modified to help the viewer retain and grasp each element or attribute a little better.
